-- *************** Notes on "current user"-privileges **********************
-- Killing a session must be performed under the current user's privileges
-- (override the PL/SQL's default "definer"-privilege model)
-- See requirement SSDD:3990 / CR 19677.
--
-- This has the following implications:
-- As little references as possible should be made to database objects
-- that are not strictly necessary, as this causes authorisation issues.
-- E.g. When in a procedure executed under the current user's privileges
--      a reference is made to, say, the procedure Viu_Info.Raise_Info,
--      the end-user (!!) must have the EXECUTE privilege on the package
--      Viu_Info (either via a role or directly), and he or she should
--      have a private synonym defined in his or her database schema
--      for Viu_Info; alternatively, a public synonym would be OK as well
-- Normally no such direct privileges and synonyms are defined for end-users.
--
-- So when executing procedures under current user's privileges
-- (AUTHID CURRENT_USER), as little references to other objects must be
-- made as possible.
--
-- That is why we do not use VIU (Enter_Module, Leave_Module, Raise_Info) here,
-- but just execute the plain code.
--
-- Any exceptions are to be catched by the calling procedure
